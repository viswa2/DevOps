## AWS Cloud Practitioner Technical Essentials ##

1. Create IAM role --> Role --> Create role --> AWS service --> s3 --> AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess --> next --> Rolename
2. Create s3 bucket for objects --> create bucket --> AWS region ex: us-east-1 --> bucket name Ex: employee-photo-bucket-00 --> Add the bucket policy --> Create bucket
3. Launch Ec2 Instance --> Instance name --> AMI from catalog --> Instance type t2.micro --> Key pair you can select or create a new key pair to connect the instance --> VPC earlier I have create app-vpc select the same --> Subnet created earlier select the same --> Create security group for Http and Https --> Advandced details --> IAM Instance profile --> select the  AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess --> Under the user data add the script for the Employee directory app --> Create Instance --> Wait a minute and check the app is working or not with the public ip in the browser.

4. IAM Instance Profile added in Advance details as created role in the first step.

4. Create the dynamo db --> Create table --> Table name --> Employees --> Partition key is id for string --> Remaining default options and create table.
5. As per the above screenshot fill the details i.e Name, Location, JobTitle and upload your photo once done save the details.
6. Go to the bucket and click on there should be employee_pic uploaded
7. Go the dynamodb and click on Tables --> Click on Table name Ex: Employees --> Explore Table Items --> There should be your details in the table i.e Name, Location and Jobtitle.

## Application Load Balancer ##

1. Launch 2 EC2 instances with the same style --> My first instance --> Number of instances 2 --> Instance type t2.micro --> Proceed without keypair --> Under network settings select existing security group which is having ssh and http indbound rule if not create a new one --> Advance details --> user data --> add user-data-for-load-balancer

2. After launching the 2 instances change the name for one of the instance from My First Instance to My Second Instance

## Replication Rules for S3 Bucket ##

1. Create a 2 buckets for replication testing i.e replication-origin and replication-destination0

<img width="1569" alt="s3-buckets-for replication-testing" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/2e096291-654e-46e5-8a7f-21e636b2c9fa">

2. Create a replication rule in `replication-origin` bucket click on Management --> Replication rule name i.e mydemo replication --> Status enabled --> Under source bucket Apply to all objects in the bucket --> Destination choose --> Choose a bucket in this account, add the bucket name i.e `replication-destination0` --> IAM role --> Create a new role --> keep remaining as default and save.

3. Upload the objects for testing with the versioning enabled
4. Go to the `replication-destination0` bucket and refresh the page you can observe same file with the same version id.

<img width="1601" alt="replication-source" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/5ca7fc5b-ea69-4171-b8f2-1318b3d5a746">

## Cloud Formation ##

CloudFormation, It's infrastructure as code. This means that you can build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision your infrastructure resources.

1. Select the region as us-east-1 otherwise things will not work.
2. Create a stack & Prerequisite â€“-> Prepare template--> select Template is ready
3. Specify Template --> select Upload a template file i.e upload from your computer or you can select Amazon S3 url as well.

<img width="1291" alt="Upload a template from computer" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/0afd6382-fbd2-4a6f-bafe-478c11b03359">

4. Provide a stack name called i.e Demo Cloudformation and click on next
5. Configure stack options provide key and value fields and click on next and submit
6. Then You can observe Events

<img width="1064" alt="Cloud-formation-Events" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/bbe6a256-1f1b-4821-841d-42ba31a39156">

7. Open the next tab and you can able to see the Ec2 intsance through the cloudformation which we have provisioned.

<img width="1485" alt="Cloud-Formation-Through-Ec2-Instance" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/a835737f-1ef5-4140-a0bd-d624ad3419d3">

8. If you want to update stack click on update stack --> replace current template --> Upload a template file with the changes. Once done it will terminate the existing resources and re-create with the new one.
   
9. If we want to delete the resources there is no need to go each and indivual resources to delete simply go and delete the stack 

## Cloud Front ##

`Note:` Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience. Caches and serves static & dynamic content it's a global service.

**Protection against network and application layer attacks**
Amazon CloudFront, AWS Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Amazon Route 53 work seamlessly together to create a flexible, layered security perimeter against multiple types of attacks including network and application layer DDoS attacks.

1. Create a bucket in S3
2. Upload with the files for cloudfront testing.

<img width="1371" alt="S3-bucket for Cloudfront" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/e46ec12b-8c6a-47c3-a6b7-17e307adaf48">

3. Now open the Object url it won't work due to AccessDenied error because we blocked the public access. This we can able to acheive by using cloudfront.

<img width="775" alt="Cloudfront demo object url" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/bd672d96-9a45-47ac-bebb-8ce6ccc1823f">

4. Next in Amaznon search i.e cloudfront & Create distribution ie choose the name of bucket object url which we was created the bucket in 1st step
5. Name of this origin i.e demo-cloudfront10.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (it's same like the distrubution)
6. Origin access public 
7. Under Web Application Firewall (WAF) select Do not enable security protections
8. under Default root object type index.html which we were uploaded earlier in s3 bucket and then click create distribution.
9. Once the distribution status is enabled click on Distribution domain name and see the magic.

<img width="358" alt="Cloudfront Image" src="https://github.com/viswa2/DevOps/assets/34201574/897a9dcd-6062-47ab-8d2d-557d76df830a">

10. You can try with the domain name with the index.html and image.jpg etc.
